VERSION 2.7

The Trap Forwarder program receives traps on any port 
(default is 162, of course) and forwards them to any destinations 
(host and port - again the port defaults to 162).

All destinations and other configurable options are specified 
in the configuration file (default is trapfwd.cfg)

To "Install" on Unix/Linux, please consult the INSTALL file.

Running the program:

  You can start trapfwd from the command line:

  >trapfwd

  which is the same as:

  >trapfwd -f trapfwd.cfg

  Of course, you could specify a different configuration file:

  >trapfwd -f myTrapFwd.cfg

  Please refer to the default configuration file for instructions on 
  modifying it for your particular configuration.

  The -o option causes trapfwd to output, periodically, run-time data (/tmp/trapfwd.stat for Unix/Linux, trapfwd.stat (current directory) for windows.

  Unix/Linux Only:
    To run trapfwd as a daemon on unix variants, specify the -d option

    >trapfwd -d

    Sending trapfwd a SIGUSR1 (kill -USR1 <pid>) will cause trapfwd to spew some
    run-time data to /tmp/trapfwd.stat


Please provide comments and suggestions via the 'contact us' page at http://www.trapreceiver.com.  If you are

your email message the file /tmp/trapfwd.err

Happy Trapping!

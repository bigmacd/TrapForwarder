#  Welcome to version 2.5 of trapfwd from Network Computing Technologies, Inc.
#
#  Notes on using trapfwd:
#
#  this is the port on which traps are expected to be received
#  typically it is udp port 162 as I know you all know
#  therefore, the default is udp port 162.

ListenPort:162

# repeated as many times as their are destinations
# TrapProtocol can be either UDP or TCP to the specified
# host and port

TrapHost:192.168.1.9
TrapPort:162
TrapProtocol:UDP

#TrapHost:joey
#TrapPort:162
#TrapProtocol:TCP

#TrapHost:
#TrapPort:
#TrapProtocol:

# new to version 2.5 
# Logging
# The following parameter specifies a log file to which trap 
# data will be written:
LogFile:trapfwd.log

# The following specifies the format of trap data written to the log file
FormatString:%T%S%v%c%g%s%t%i%o%bOTD
# %v - print version 0 for V1, 1 for V2
# %c - print community string
# %g - print generic type (V1 only)
# %s - print specific type (V1 only)
# %t - print timestamp
# %i - print sender's IP address
# %o - print sender's OID (V1 only)
# %b - print varbind data; MUST be followed by one or more of the following:
# O - print varbind Oid
# T - print varbind Type
# D - print varbind Data
# These can be specified in any order (except the %b must always be 
# followed by 'O', 'T', and/or 'D').  Here's a couple of examples:
# %i%bOTD - prints sender's IP and all varbind data
# %v%i%bOD%c - prints version, sender's IP, varbind OID and Data, and
# community string.

# also new to version 2.5
# Listening Interface
# The following parameter specifies which interface to bind to when
# trapfwd listens for traps.  This parameter is for systems with multiple
# interfaces only.  Leave commented out to let the system decide (INADDR_ANY).
# InterfaceIp:127.0.0.1

# new to version 2.6
# the above mentioned FormatString contains two new formatting characters:
# %T and %S.  %T will output the trap's timestamp in a human readable 
# form.  %S will output the system's (on which trapfwd is running) current
# date and time

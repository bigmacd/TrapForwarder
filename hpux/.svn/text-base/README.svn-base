VERSION 2.6

The Trap Forwarder program receives traps on any port 
(default is 162, of course) and forwards them to any destinations 
(host and port - again the port defaults to 162).

A makefile is provided that will install the trapfwd files and set the 
startup-scripts so that trapfwd will start on boot-up and stop on shutdown.

>make 

This will install trapfwd and trapfwd.cfg into /usr/local/bin as well as
setting up the /etc/init.d startup script(s)

If you are upgrading from a version 2.5, please see the enclosed
trapfwd.cfg file for new configuration options, and you make simply copy 
the enclosed trapfwd executable over top of the existing one (usually
located in /usr/local/trapfwd).  

All destinations and other configurable options are specified 
in the configuration file (default is trapfwd.cfg)

Alternatively, you can start trapfwd from the command line:

>trapfwd -f trapfwd.cfg

Please refer to the default configuration file for instructions on 
modifying it for your particular configuration.

To run trapfwd as a daemon on unix variants, specify the -d option

>trapfwd -d

Sending trapfwd a SIGUSR1 (kill -USR1 <pid>) will cause trapfwd to spew some
run-time data to /tmp/trapfwd.stat

Please provide comments and suggestions to trapfwd@ncomtech.com.  If you are
reporting problems running trapfwd on unix variants, please also include with
your email message the file /tmp/trapfwd.err

Happy Trapping!

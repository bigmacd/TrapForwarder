Hello and welcome to trapfwd from Network Computing Technologies, Inc.


To install this software, please follow these simple steps:


1) Select a destination directory to store the program and config file.
   The default is /usr/local/trapfwd.  i
2) Set this directory information in the makefile ("makefile").  There 
   at the top is a variable called PROGDESTDIR.  Change this variable  
   to the destination directory you have selected.
3) Set this directory information in the startup script ("trapforwarder"). There
   at the top is a variable also called PROGDESTDIR.  Change this variable  
   to the destination directory you have selected.
4) Type "make".  This will place the executable ("trapfwd") and configuration 
   file ("trapfwd.cfg") in the PROGDESTDIR.  It will place the startup script
   ("trapforwarder") in the system's startup script directory and link it to the 
   appropriate state startup scripts ("K" and "S" files).
5) Edit the config file ("trapfwd.cfg") in PROGDESTDIR to suite your needs.
   Details on configurable options are in the config file.
6) Wind it up.  Well, start it up anyway ("./trapforwarder start").


As always, your comments and suggestions are more than welcome.  Please send a 
message to trapfwd@ncomtech.com and please indicate your operating system.

Send the trapfwd process a SIGUSR1 and then look for the file /tmp/trapfwd.stat.  
It has some useful information on what the program is doing.  If there are 
problems running the program, check the /tmp directory for a file called 
trapfwd.err.  Maybe it will provide some clues.

Happy Trapping!
